        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 cup cake flour</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups white sugar, divided</li>
            <li>12 egg whites</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons cream of tartar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>            
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Clean and fully dry a 10-inch tube pan.</li>
            <li>Sift together flour, and 3/4 cup sugar, set aside.</li>
            <li>Whip egg whites, along with vanilla, cream of tartar, and salt, in a large bowl to medium stiff peaks. 
                Gradually add remaining 3/4 cup sugar while continuing to whip to stiff peaks. 
                When the egg white mixture has reached its maximum volume, fold in the sifted ingredients gradually, 
                1/3 at a time. Do not over-mix. Put the batter into the tube pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cake springs back when touched, 40 to 45 minutes</li>
            <li>Balance the tube pan upside down on the top of a bottle to prevent decompression while cooling. 
                When cool, run a knife around the edge of the pan and invert onto a plate.</li>
        </ol>
