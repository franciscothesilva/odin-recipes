            Making bakery-worthy chocolate chip cookies is much easier than it seems.
        </p>
       

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Butter</strong>: This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. 
                The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.</li>
            <li><strong>Vanilla</strong>: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.</li>
            <li><strong>Baking soda</strong>: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li>
            <li><strong>Water</strong>: A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.</li>            
            <li><strong>Flour</strong>: All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.</li>
            <li><strong>Chocolate chips</strong>: Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.</li>
            <li><strong>Nuts</strong> (optional): Walnuts are optional, but they add nutty flavor and a welcome crunch.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Beat the butter and sugars, then beat in the eggs and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Dissolve the baking soda in hot water and add to the mixture.</li>
            <li>Stir in the flour, chocolate chips, and walnuts.</li>
            <li>Drop dough onto a prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake until the edges are golden brown.</li>
        </ol>
